Antistentorian is a all in one transcription app utilizing faster-whisper to transcribe; your default recording device, a drag-and-dropped audio or video file, and now transcripts from youtube urls. Saved transcriptions are in the same directory as the files or into the Transcripts folder.
The generated text is now displayed inside the UI. 

Enjoy.
